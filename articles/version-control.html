    <p>Version control software serve the purpose of systematically organizing different versions of a project through history. The benefit is making work history parsable, which is turn means that progress can be applied methodically and rolled back when thigs go tits up. There are multiple different tools for this purpose, the most ubiquitous one being <strong>Git</strong></p>
    <p>For the time being, this is the only type of version control covered in this wiki.</p>

    <p>Linus Torvalds, the son of a bitch, wipped up his own operating system kernel when he felt the ones available didn't fit the bill. In order to make work easier, he also designed his own version control system. <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, so named partly as a joke, works by storing a complete repository of all changes done in a given directory. This data is always stored in full on the machine where the repository is located. In other words, git operates perfectly offline, and allows a synced workflow by following a predetermined protocol and workflow.</p>
