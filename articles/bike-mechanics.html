  <h2 id="terminology">TERMINOLOGY</h2>
  <section class="sub-section">
    <p>A <span class="keyword">Cog</span> is a tooth attached to some kind of wheel. A <span class="keyword">Cogwheel</span> is any kind of wheel that has teeth(i.e cogs). A <span class="keyword">Sprocket</span> is a wheel with teeth that that mesh with some kind of perforated or indented material, e.g a chain or belt. The difference here is somewhat semantic, but when discussing any or either of these terms in relation to a bike, one is discussing either the whole drivetrain or a single step on it.</p>

  <section class="sub-section">
    <h3>SPOKES</h3>
    <p>Spokes consist of the metal spoke itself, which on one end is flattened to fasten it to the hub. On the other end it is threaded. The nipple is a nut with threads on the inside. When looking through the rim, into the hub of the wheel, a clockwise rotation of the nipple will tighten it.</p>
