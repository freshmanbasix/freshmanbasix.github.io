  <p>Of all available encryption methods, one very common and reliable kind is the <i>private public keypair model</i>. The idea is that a user has two keys; one private that can decrypt (unlock) messages meant only for the owner, and public that encrypts (locks) a message meant for a specific recipient.</p>

  <p>Assymetric encryption can be achieved on a linux machine using the <code>gpg</code> terminal utility. Below follows an example of how one might use the gpg command line tool to encrypt an arbitrary <i>input-file</i> to be decryptable only by the intended recipient.</p>

  <pre class="code-snippet">  $ gpg --encrypt input-file --armor --recipient UID --output output-file </pre>
