    <p>This article will contain purely mathematical theory, starting from the very basic high school level, and focusing on a calculus oriented subset of the field. Over time, it will capture most of the spectrum that one studies during the course of any general engineering program. Some niche fields will warrant individual articles in turn.</p>
    <p>Calculus is primarily oriented at expanding the field of algebra into more complex territories and multiple dimensional analysis. Some basic arithmetic and notational convention are also served here due to the area being so fundamental to all subsequent fields.</p>
    <p>Several concepts in this article will technically belong to fields of their own, but until such a time that enough material warrants a new article, it will remain in here.</p>

    <h3>MATHEMATICAL BUILDING BLOCKS</h3>
    <p>An <span class="keyword">Equation</span> is a pair of expressions that have some stated relationship. They can be <em>equal(=)</em>, <em>strictly non-equal(≠)</em> or <em>unequal(&lt, ⋜, &gt, ⋝)</em>.</p>
    <div class="box formula math">x + m = y       [equation]</div>

    <p><span class="keyword">Inequalities</span> or <span class="keyword">Intervals</span> is a shorthand for equations where the expressions do not evaluate to the same. Intervals in particular describe a range within which an expression exists on the numberline</p>

    <div class="box formula math">[inequality] x + m &lt y</div>
    <div class="box formula math">[interval] x &lt m &lt y</div>

    <p>Component names for the basic operations are listed below.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Addend</b> + <b>Addend</b> = <b>Sum</b></li>
      <li><b>Minuend</b> - <b>Subtrahend</b> = <b>Difference</b></li>
      <li><b>Term</b> + <b>Term</b> = <b>Sum</b> <em>(for use with both positive and negative terms)</em></li>
      <li><b>Factor</b> × <b>Factor</b> = <b>Product</b></li>
      <li><b>Dividend</b> ÷ <b>Divisor</b> = <b>Quotient</b></li>
      <li><b>Numerator</b> ÷ <b>Denominator</b> = <b>Quotient</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>NUMBER PROPERTIES</h3>
    <p class="addme">commutative, associative etc.</p>
    <p>The <span class="keyword">Commutative</span> property describe whether the order of the operands matter in a given operation. Addition is commutative, since <span class="inline-math">a + b = b + a</span> for any <span class="inline-math">{a, b ∈ ℝ}</span>. Multiplication is another example, but subtraction is not since <span class="inline-math">a - b ≠ b - a</span>.</p>

    <p>Which operands to resolve first under a given operation is determined by the <span class="keyword">Associative</span> property. Addition and Multiplication are associative for example, because the following holds true: <span class="inline-math">(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)</span> and <span class="inline-math">(a × b) × c = a × (b × c)</span>.</p>

    <p>The <span class="keyword">Distributive</span> property describe how a operand is distributed into an expression containing multiple terms under multiplication. <span class="inline-math">a(b + c) = a×b + a×c</span>.</p>

    <p>If an operation is conducted with any two operands from the same set, and the result belongs to the same set, then this set is said to be <span class="keyword">Closed</span> under this operation.</p>

    <p>All operations have a <span class="keyword">Neutral Element</span>, also refered to as the <span class="keyword">Identity</span>. For any operand from some set <span class="inline-math">a</span>, there is a <span class="inline-math">neutral(a)</span> such that <span class="inline-math">a + neutral(a) = a</span>. In addition, the identity is 0, for multiplication, the identity is 1.</p>

    <p><span class="keyword">Inverse Elements</span> are such that a operation will result in the identity for the given operation. As such, the inverse will be different depending on the number itself. For addition; <span class="inline-math">a + inverse(a) = 0</span>. For multiplication; <span class="inline-math">b × inverse(b) = 1</span>. Inverses in addition is the number with equal magnitude but opposite side of 0 on the numberline. In multiplication, the inverse is called the <span class="keyword">reciprocal</span>, which is always 1 divided by the number itself, i.e <span class="inline-math">inverse(b) = 1 ÷ b</span>.</p>

  <section class="sub-section">
    <p>Geometry is the mathematical field concerned with space, dimensions, shapes, size and distances.</p>

    <h3>COORDINATE SYSTEMS</h3>
    <p>A coordinate system is a organized set of numerical values representing a point in a space of some dimensions. Three such system are the <span class="keyword">Cartesian</span>, <span class="keyword">cylindrical</span> and <span class="keyword">Spehrical</span> coordinate systems. Different systems have differing benefits and drawbacks, mainly depending on what is being depicted, and what kind of operations are being performed.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="rsc/calculus/geometry/coordinate-conversion-chart.png" alt="image">
      <figcaption>Simple conversion chart in ℝ <sup>3</sup> between <em>Cartesian</em> and the two forms of <em>Polar</em> coordinates, i.e cylindrical and spherical. </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h4>CARTESIAN COORDINATES</h4>
    <p><span class="keyword">Cartesian Coordinates</span> is the common standard of representing space by letting each point in  <span class="inline-math">P = [x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>] ∈ ℝ<sup>n</sup></span> be represented by a multiple of 1 on n orthoganal axis. The regular xy-plane is often refered to as the <em>cartesian plane</em>. <span class="keyword">Euclidean Standard Space</span> ℝ<sup>3</sup>, i.e physical 3D space, is usually represented as <span class="inline-math">[x, y, z]</span> in cartesian coordinates.</p>
    <p>It is used as the basis as the common <span class="keyword">right-hand system</span>, which is a method to standardize direction in a system. It is defined by taking your right hand and letting:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the thumbbe the positive x-axis</li>
      <li>the index finger be the positive y-axis</li>
      <li>the long finger be the positive z-axis</li>
      <li>The circular rotation around the z-axis, from the positive x-axis to the negative, is considered to be of a positive magnitude</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Positive rotation around the z axis represents position movement along the z-axis. A common example is the common threaded screw, which is screwed into a material by rotating it clockwise when the screw faces away from you.</p>

    <h4>POLAR COORDINATES</h4>
    <p>In a polar system, a ray between the point <span class="inline-math">P</span> is set as a polar axis, and the line through that pole has a single angle. The magnitude of this line from point to origin and the angle make up the polar coordinates. This system is usually best used for <span class="keyword">Cylindrical [r, θ, z]</span> and <span class="keyword">Spherical [R, θ, ϕ]</span> objects in space. This can be used to very easily calculate points of a spherical or cylindrical surface, or determine volumes etc.</p>

    <h3>COMPLEX NUMBERS ℂ</h3>
    <p><span class="keyword">Complex Numbers</span> are numbers with both real and imaginary components. The <span class="keyword">Imaginary Number Set 𝕀</span> is defined as all multiples of the <span class="keyword">Imaginary Unit i</span>, <span class="inline-math">𝕀 = [∀(i × x)]</span> such that <span class="inline-math">x ∈ ℝ</span> and <span class="inline-math">i = sqrt{ -1 }</span>. The square root of minus one, or any negative number, does not exist in the real number space, and as such lack a definition. The number 𝑖 was created to model the circumstances where real numbers are insufficient. Common applications are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number#Applications">listed on the wikipedia page for the concept</a>. Generally, any polynomial expression whose range does not contain y = 0 will require a complex solution, i.e any parabola completely above or below the x-axis.</p>
    <p>Complex numbers are a special case of two dimensional vectors, existing as a point on the <span class="keyword">Imaginary Numberplane</span>, which is made up of all linear combinations of the orthogonal Real and Imaginary Number lines. This space has the standard basis <span class="inline-math">[1, i]</span>. Commonly, complex numbers are denoted with the variable <span class="inline-math"><b>Z</b></span>, with the boldface emphasising its vector properties. Each complex number <b>Z</b> will also have a <span class="keyword">Complex Conjugate</span>, which exists on the mirror image, i.e opposite side, of the real line, commonly denoted with a bar.</p>

      <img src="rsc/calculus/geometry/complex-plane.png" alt="image">
      <figcaption>Cartesian illustration of a complex number and its associated notation</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>There are several forms of the complex number, all offering different benefits when performing calculations</p>
    <div class="box formula math"><b>Z</b> = α + 𝑖 × β &#9&#9&#9(Cartesian Form) <br><b>Z</b> |<b>Z</b>|(cos θ, 𝑖 × in θ) &#9&#9(Polar Form) <br><b>Z</b> = |<b>Z</b>| × e <sup>𝑖 × θ</sup>&#9&#9&#9(Euler Form)</div>

    <p>The different components of a complex number have some particular noation. The <span class="keyword">Imaginary component</span> <span class="inline-math">Im(<b>Z</b>) = β</span>, The <span class="keyword">Real component</span> <span class="inline-math">Re(<b>Z</b>) = α</span>. And lastly the <span class="keyword">Argument</span> <span class="inline-math">Arg(<b>Z</b>) = θ</span>. The argument has a few special rules similar to that of the logarithm rules.</p>
    <div class="box formula math">Arg(<b>Z</b> × <b>W</b>) = Arg(<b>Z</b>) + Arg(<b>W</b>) <br>Arg(<b>Z</b> ÷ <b>W</b>) = Arg(<b>Z</b>) - Arg(<b>W</b>)</div>
