  <section class="sub-section">
    <h3>APACHE2</h3>
    <p>Apache is a very common web server solution that can run on most devices and machines. <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/">Full documentation available from apache project website</a>.</p>

    <h4>INSTALL</h4>
    <p>The following installs the apache package on a debian linux OS.</p>
    <div class="box snippet code">sudo apt-get install apache2</div>

    <p>The default site can be visited through a browser by typing <span class="inline-code">localhost</span> or <span class="inline-code">127.0.0.1</span>. If you see a simple site declaring <em>Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page</em>, or something similar, the package has been configured correctly.</p>

    <p>Config files for apache are located in <span class="inline-code">/etc/apache2</span>. The default location for the outward facing website <span class="inline-code">/var/www/html</span></p>

    <h4>VIRTUAL HOSTS</h4>
    <p>Multiple websites can be hosted from the same apache server by configuring virtual hosts. Several variants ca be configured. In general, each host can be stored in a dedicated directory, preferably directly under <span class="inline-code">/var/www</span>. For each host, a configuration file must be setup in the <span class="inline-code">/etc/apache2/sites-available</span> directory. <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/">The officials docs host some useful information here</a>, and a practical <a href="https://www.bestdevops.com/setup-virtual-hosts-with-apache-web-server-on-linux/">tutorial is hosted here</a>.</p>

    <h3>DNS services</h3>
    <p>The <i>Domain Name System</i> infrastructure is what translates a human-readable web adress. This service needs to be bought. While technically possible, setting up your own private DNS server will only be plausible on a local network. On the internet, we turn to Domain Name Registrars.</p>

    <p>Here is a useful, quite indepth, <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/36/11/how-do-i-start-using-dynamic-dns/">tutorial</a> for domain names bought at namecheap.com</p>

  <h2 id="torrent-server">Torrent Server</h2>

  <section class="sub-section">
    <p>Many torrent clients have built in support for running a background daemon on the server side and controlling it for a specialized gui on the client side. Deluge, for one, does so well.</p>
    <p class="box attention">All components need to be the same main version! For example Deluge is version 1.3 in Debian package managers, but 2.0 on Ubuntu which will cause issues. See <a href="https://deluge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/01-install.html">these</a> instructions for installing the newest version</p>

    <p>Before reading the tutorials below, see this simplified overview:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Server Side</li>
      <ul>
        <li><b>deluged</b> is the daemon running in the background and serves as the engine</li>
        <li><b>deluge-console</b> is a command line interface with deluged that is used to manage torrents, files etc. In a minimal setup, these two programs are the only thing necessary to have a torrent server up and running and control it via ssh</li>
        <li><b>deluge-web</b> is an additional application necessary to support deluge's web browser interface (web ui)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Client Side</li>
      <ul>
        <li><b>deluge</b> or <b>deluge-gtk</b> are the standard torrent clients that users install on their computers. Can be set to operate as <i>thin client</i> which is a completely networked based version. Both modes are built in out of the box</li>
        <li><b>deluge web</b> ui is the browser based version of the normal gui</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>If things turn sour, keep it simple and use only deluged and deluge-console. </p>
    <p>If you do create a dedicated user for just the deluge daemon, remember to be logged in as that user when changing config and test-running the interface </p>

    <ul>

      <li><a href="https://deluge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to/systemd-service.html">Deluge Tutorial for setting up server daemon and running thinclient on local machine</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.techjunkie.com/create-a-headless-torrent-server-with-deluge-on-a-raspberry-pi/">Simplified tutorial that also includes using a vpn and external harddrive for storage. Use this if things become to messy with deluges official tutorials</a></li>

  <h2 id="network-storage-backup">Network Storage and Backup</h2>

  <section class="sub-section">
    <p>When making your own google drive solution, you'll want to achieve one or more out the following outcomes</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Synchronize Data</b>: A server and client directory is updated live to match exactly and respond immediately to any changes on either end. All data is stored both on local machine and on server</li>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Rsync</b></li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Network Drive Mapping</b>: Data is only stored on the server side, but a easily accessible symbolic link is established on the local machine. Depending on latency, files can be executed directly over the network</li>
      <ul>
        <li><b>SMB Network Drive</b></li>
        <li><b>NAS</b></li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Backup</b>: Serve as a complete copy of the system state at a given time. Used as fallback at times of failure.</li>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Bash Script & Crontab</b></li>
        <li><b>3d party clients</b></li>
      </ul>
