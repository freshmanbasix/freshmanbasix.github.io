    <p>Managing a linux system is an excellent way to spend 10000 hours that you're never getting back. This article intends to list all things under the sun that pertains to how a linux machine operates, and how to manage the resources made available to its users. Take note that in the eyes of the authors of this wiki, the sun only ever really shines on the terminal.</p>

    <p>Always remember; the true Linux repair-man will repair man!</p>

  <h2 id="users-groups">Users & Groups</h2>
  <section class="sub-section">
    <p>While the Kernel Layer controls distribution of resources and access at the hardware level, the User Layer offers <i>users</i> and <i>groups</i> as a means of delimiting and segregating access to a device in the linux environment. Essentially, a user, or a group of users get some level of access to each resource and directory available at the user level. This is all in turn controlled by the <i>super user</i>, providing a hierarchy of access. In most cases, a user will be a person, and groups will be particular extra priviliges that users can be given. On most computers, there will be a very limited number of users, if even more than one, but for a server or network device, there may be a large pool of users with a multitude of groups.</p>

    <h3>User & Group Data</h3>
    <p><code>/etc/passwd</code> contains all users on a system. Each line represent a user, with data fields being separated with colon <code>:</code> with fields containing the following information</p>

    <p><strong>&ltUsername&gt : &ltpassword&gt : &ltUID&gt : &ltGID&gt : &ltComment&gt : &lthome directory&gt : &ltshell used&gt</strong></p>

    <p>If the password is x â†’ it is encrypted. Encrypted passwords are stored in <code>/etc/shadow</code></p>

    <p>Similarly, all groups are listed in <code>/etc/group</code> on the following format:</p>
    <p><strong>&ltgroup name&gt : &ltpassword&gt : &ltGID&gt : &ltusers in the group used&gt</strong></p>

    <p>One very practical way of printing basic user info to the terminal is by piping the content of passwd into cut, which will use : as separator, and only output the first field per line. <code>-d</code> signifies the separator wanted, <code>-f</code> sets the range of fields that should be printed.</p>

    <pre class="box snippet">$ cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1</pre>

    <h3>Modifying Users</h3>
    <p><code>useradd</code>,<code>userdel</code>,<code>usermod</code> are low level command line tools which can be used to create, delete and modify users on a machine. Respectively, <code>groupadd</code>, <code>groupdel</code>, and <code>groupmod</code> are all corresponding tools for groups.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, <code>adduser</code>,<code>deluser</code>, <code>addgroup</code> and <code>delgroup</code> offer somewhat more versatile versions of the same utility which depending on the desired outcome might be a more appropriate option.</p>
    <p>Here is a forum post discussing the<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/80277/whats-the-difference-between-a-normal-user-and-a-system-user">difference between a normal and system user</a>. Meanwhile, this article give a good initial <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/80277/whats-the-difference-between-a-normal-user-and-a-system-user">initial introduction to the passwd file</a>.</p>

    <h3>Permissions</h3>
    <p>Viewing permissions of any file or directory is essentially achieved with <code>ls -la</code></p>
    <pre class="box snippet">-rwxrw-r--    1    root   root 2048    Jan 13 07:11 afile.txt
(    1   )    2      3      4    5     (     6    ) (   7   )</pre>
    <ol>
      <li>Permission Mode bits. In order of owner, group, other</li>
      <li>Number of hard links</li>
      <li>owner username file/directory</li>
      <li>owner group associated with file/directory</li>
      <li>file size in bytes</li>
      <li>time of last modification</li>
      <li>file/directory name</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Super Users</h3>
    <blockquote class="q" cite="">
      Of all the gods of mount olympus, The super user is the greatest, for his was the power to accidentally wipe away the entire world...
    </blockquote>
    <p>Every admin user technically has a dedicated password that elevates them to super user status. It however, not set by default and must be activated separately. There is no need to do it though, because <code>$ sudo su</code> will achieve the same results. Once in su mode, you will never be prompted for an admin confirmation again.</p>

    <h3>Disk Usage</h3>
    <p>To get started, check out this primer for <a href="https://alligator.io/workflow/command-line-basics-analyzing-disk-usage/">command line disk usage analysis</a>.</p>

    <p><code>df -h</code> prints summary of each mounted partition and how much available space is left for each. The <code>-h</code> or <code>--human-readable</code> option designates output about file system usage to be in powers of 1024 bytes</p>

    <p><code>fdisk</code> is the standard command utility used to <strong>create, delete, list</strong> and <strong>analyze disk partitions</strong></p>

    <p>Output partitions of a given device:</p>
    <pre class="box snippet">$ sudo fdisk -l &ltdevice&gt</pre>

    <p>To <strong>edit partitions</strong> you might use the <strong>interactive utility tools</strong> giving &ltdevice&gt as the argument:</p>
    <pre class="box snippet">$ sudo fdisk /dev/sda</pre>

    <h3>Memory & Processor Usage</h3>
    <p><code>htop</code>. Go get it.</p>
