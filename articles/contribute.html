    <p>In this article, complete instructions on how to practically go about making a contribution to the wiki will be documented. For the foreseeable future, it will be required by an author to get aquainted with the particular way that the website is designed and styled. Be aware that these particular solutions might not always be optimal, or even very good, from a conventional perspective. This does leave a great deal of room to make contributions that improve on these rag-tag, homemade design decitions. If you find something on this wiki that is crap and you have a good idea on how it might become less so, then keep reading this article and submit your suggestions.</p>

  <h2 id="external-resources">EXTERNAL RESOURCES</h2>
  <section class="sub-section">
    <p>The wiki is compeletely stored on a Git repository, meaning any change is done through pull requests. This offers an existing open source framework for managing, moderating and administrating the wiki without any need for user accounts. The repo is currently publicly hosted on Github and you'll find it <a href="https://github.com/freshmanbasix/freshmanbasix.github.io">right here</a>.</p>

    <p>For managing active maintenance and tasks pertaining to the wiki, there's a <a href="https://trello.com/b/ZHplhRZO/wikifreshmanbasix">publicly readable Trello board</a> which can be used by anyone to view what sort of improvements have already been identified and what is being worked on.</p>

    <p>If you would like to grab an improvement task for yourself, or perhaps suggest one, an email is the way to go. Just shoot an email to <a href="mailto:hjalle@freshmanbasix.com">hjalle@freshmanbasix.com</a>. If interest ever grows large enough, there might appear a discord server as well. Time will tell.</p>

  <h2 id="directory-hierarchy">DIRECTORY HIERARCHY</h2>
  <section class="sub-section">
    <p>Under the <b>root</b>, the wiki is organized into a few simple folders. The complexity remains quite low which allows for the website directory to consist only a small number of files.</p>

    <div class="box snippet code">
<b>root/</b>--
      |-index.html
      |-style.css
      |-<b>style/</b>-
      |       |-stylesheet_category.css
      |-CNAME
      |-README.md
      |-<b>scripts/</b>-
      |         |-script.js
      |
      |-<b>rsc/</b>-
      |     |-<b>article</b>-
      |              |-<b>section</b>-

      |
      |-<b>articles/</b>-
                 |-article.html
</div>

    <ul>
      <li><b>index.html</b> is the core of the website, being loaded as the default on a web request. This file should ONLY contain the primary framework of the website, leaving the actual content distributed elsewhere.</li>
      <li><b>style.css</b> is the general stylesheet, linked in index.html. This file imports all members under the <b>style/</b> directory, which individually contain the complete styling ruleset, categorized by function.</li>
      <li><b>README.md</b> is a github specific file that only corresponds to the github repo <em>Readme</em> section.</li>
      <li><b>CNAME</b> is for the CNAME record at the domain name registrar.</li>
      <li>All js scripts are located under the <b>scripts/</b> directory. Remember that each added scripts must be imported with a script element in index.html.</li>
      <li>The <b>articles/</b> folder contain the primary content of each article. The article IDs correspond to the name of the file exactly, subtracting the file ending.</li>
      <li>Every file, image or other visual resource useed somewhere in the wiki should be stored under the <b>rsc/</b> directory. Create subdirectories in the suggested manner to avoid long file names and be sure to name the file in a consise and clear way.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 id="html-map-overview">HTML MAP OVERVIEW</h2>
  <section class="sub-section">
    <p>The core content of the wiki is contained within a CSS flexbox dividing itself into 3 columns where the central columns contains the main article and is 4 times as wide as the outer ones.</p>

    </figure>

    <h3>NAVIGATION BAR</h3>
    <p>The leftmost column offers an overview and navigation of articles. Under the nav element with <b>id="nav-bar"</b> is an unordered list, with each <em>li</em> formated as follows:</p>

    <div class="box snippet code">&ltli class="nav-item"&gt
  &lta href="#<em>article-route</em>"&gt<em>ARTICLE-NAME</em>&lt/a&gt
&lt/li&gt</div>

    <p>Each list-item must have the class attribute set to <b>nav-item</b> and contain an anchor element with the href attribute set to call the javascript function <em>openArticle()</em>.</p>

    <h3>WIKI ARTICLE COLUMN</h3>
    <p>The article itself is contained within the <em>main</em> element with id <em>wiki-column</em>. The whole article itself is stored inside a <em>article</em> element which has an id value corresponding to the article file name, as found in the <em>/articles</em> directory. It also has the class value <em>wiki-entry</em>. In general, the article is divided into several <em>section</em> elements, the first of which also contains the table of contents. Below follows a diagram along with core example code to illustrate how the hierarchy of a article must be structured to render properly.</p>

    <div class="box snippet code">
&ltarticle id="<em>file-name</em>" class="wiki-entry"&gt

  &lth1 class="column-header"&gt<em>Title</em>&lt/h1&gt

  &ltsection class="sub-section"&gt

    &ltdiv id="toc-container"&gt

  &ltsection class="sub-section"&gt

    &ltp&gt <em>Sub section content</em> &lt/p&gt

  &lt/section&gt

&lt/article&gt
    </div>

    <p class="box attention">Note that each <b>h2</b> header preceeds the <b>section</b> element for each sub-section. This was chosen because it made it simpler to reliably make the margins larger for the text content than the header itself. It does feel slightly unintuitive though, so an alternate solution is being worked on. </p>

    <h3>CALENDAR</h3>

    <p class="addme">This section is under construction but will one day contain a calendar for events related to the Kista Mentorspace.</p>

    <h3 id="routing">ROUTING</h3>
    <p>The site uses a simple implementation of page routing designed by Santiago Garc√≠a da Rosa, original github repository <a href="https://github.com/SantiagoGdaR/vanilla-spa">is located here</a>. It uses a simple combination of hashchange and XMLHttpRequest.</p>

    </figure>


    <p>For an article to be navigable, an entry must be manually added in the constructor call in <span class="inline code">/scripts/wiki-column.js</span> on the format:</p>
    <div class="box snippet code">new Route('<em>article-name</em>', '<em>article-name</em>.html')</div>

  </section>

  <!-- STYLE RULES -->
  <h2 id="formating-style-rules">FORMATING AND STYLE-RULES</h2>
  <section class="sub-section">
    <p>The styling in the wiki is built on the assumption that all articles are written and formated in a consistent way. It does not make use of any kind of third party documentation framework or software. It is simply done completely by hand. There are a number of predefined blocks that can be used to present information in a effective way. Below follows the available elements that can be used, along with descriptions and examples.</p>

    <p>All predefined components listed below make up ALL components with pre-existing styling that fit consistently. Of course, anything not mentioned should fit just fine and may be used freely. The components that are listed however MUST be written that way for consistency of presentation.</p>

    <p>A few words should be said about <b>display style</b> and <b>nesting</b> before going further. Elements that are not explicitly intended by the default HTML style to be inline elements should not be used as such. It is the recomended practice to add content one component at a time. The <b>exception</b> being lists. <em>Inside the &ltli&gt</em> tag, any component can essentially be added in series to achieve an effective slight increase in margin size.</p>

    <p class="box attention">Note that each<b>&ltli&gt</b> elements do not have to contain a paragraph element. Only this list items containing multiple paragraphs will need the content wrapped further.</p>

    <h3>REGULAR BLOCKS</h3>
    <p>Two levels of <strong>Sub-sub-sections</strong> are supported by the css styling. <b>h3</b> and <b>h4</b> elements are all that are needed.</p>

    <p>The plain <b>&ltp&gt</b> element is all you need to create a correctly styled <strong>Paragraph</strong>. Each paragraph of text need an element on its own. Manual linebreaks inside p elements are to be avoided</p>

    <p>To mark out points where future <strong>TODOs</strong> should be added, there is a dedicated &ltp&gt element with the class attribute set to <em>addme</em>. It will render a very eyecathcing and pretty ugly object. Use them mainly to quickly mark out the general idea of what should be added.</p>
    <div class="box snippet code">&ltp class="addme"&gt&lt/p&gt</div>
    <p class="addme">The todos will look like this.</p>

    <h3>INLINE BLOCKS</h3>
    <p>Basic boldface and italic text can be used with the native &ltb&gt tag for plain <b>boldface</b> and &ltem&gt is for <em>cursive</em> text.</p>
    <div class="box attention">Math has dedicated styling objects, see the <a href="#math-styling">math styling section below</a></div>
    <p>For specialized styling, there are earmarked styling rules that can be used with a <b>span</b> element to achieve particular inline blocks. For marking out programming snippets or general <span class="inline code">code-adjacent terms</span>, use the example below.</p>
    <div class="box snippet code">&ltspan class="inline code"&gt <em>Place inline code here</em> &lt/span&gt</div>
    <p>For general <span class="keyword">keywords</span> or concepts that have special importance and need to stick out of the paragraph, use the following example.</p>
    <div class="box snippet code">&ltspan class="keyword"&gt <em>Place inline keyword here</em> &lt/span&gt</div>

    <h3>EMPASIZED BLOCKS</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Blockquotes</strong> can be created in a styled fashion by using the <b>&ltblockquote&gt</b> element inside i <b>&ltfigure&gt</b> element along with a added <b>&ltfigcaption&gt</b>.</p>
      <div class="box snippet code">&ltfigure class="blockquote"&gt
  &ltblockquote cite="<em>optional link to source</em>"&gt
    &ltp&gt<em>Actual quote</em>&lt/p&gt
  &lt/blockquote&gt
  &ltfigcaption&gt- <em>source</em>, &ltcite&gt&lta href="<em>link to source</em>"&gt<em>link text</em>&lt/a&gt&lt/cite&gt&lt/figcaption&gt
&lt/figure&gt</div>
      <figure class="blockquote">
        <blockquote cite="">
          <p>This is what the blockquote will look like</p>
        </blockquote>
        <figcaption>- Hjalle <cite><a href="https://hjallesoft.com">Hjallesoft homepage</a></cite></figcaption>
      </figure></li>

      <li><p><strong>Figures & Images</strong> are added in a <em>Latex-esque</em> manner, using the <b>&ltfigure&gt</b> element as an environment, the <b>&ltimg&gt</b> as the image source, and lastly the <b>&ltfigcaption&gt</b> element used to pop on a nice image caption.</p>
      <div class="box snippet code">
&ltfigure&gt
&ltimg src="<em>filepath</em>" alt=""&gt
&ltfigcaption&gt<em>Caption</em>&lt/figcaption&gt
&lt/figure&gt
      </div>
      <figure>
        <img src="rsc/site/logo-hjallium.jpg" alt="image">
        <figcaption>An example of what an image will look in a sub-section. The file can be <a href="rsc/site/logo-hjallium.jpg">downloaded directly here</a></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p class="box attention">Take note that for any diagram the caption should include a link to a xml file that can be used to edit the image itself without startng from scratch. Source files are all stored in the <b>/rsc</b> directory.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>Code snippets</strong> are simple boxes with example code. A <b>&ltdiv&gt</b> element with the class attribute set to <em>"box snippet code"</em> will render the box correctly. Be aware that the code cnippet box renders ALL text as written in the html file, which includes the indentation. So if you don't push it back to the beginning of the line manually, it's going to look bonkers.</p>
      <div class="box snippet code">&ltdiv class="box snippet code"&gt<em>Put your example code here and it will be rendered like this box</em>&lt/div&gt</div>

      <li><p><strong>Attention blocks</strong> are a good way to make some very important information stick out like a smack in the face.</p>
      <div class="box snippet code">&ltdiv class="box attention"&gt<em>Put something extra important here...</em>&lt/div&gt</div>
      <div class="box attention">... and the info will render like this</div>
    </ul>

    <h3>TABLES</h3>
    <p><strong>Tables</strong> are currently only supported in two-column form, with each column eating up 50% of the width. The most appropriate use is to simply make visually appealing lists of resource and link pairs.</p>
    <div class="box snippet code">
&lttable&gt
  &ltcaption&gt<em>top caption</em>&lt/caption&gt
  &ltcolgroup span="2"&gt&lt/colgroup&gt
  &lttr&gt
    &lttd&gt<em>description</em>&lt/td&gt
    &lttd&gt<em>link</em>&lt/td&gt
  &lt/tr&gt
&lt/table&gt</div>

  <h2 id="math">MATH-EQUATIONS AND STYLING</h2>
  <section class="sub-section">



    <h3 id="math-styling">MATH ELEMENTS</h3>
    <p>Several classes have been designed specifically for mathematical notes. They are all described below. Keep in mind to use the latex signifiers for inline and display mode math equations as described above.</p>

    <h4>INLINE MATH EXPRESSIONS</h4>
    This inline block will look a lot like the inline code element, but they should not be used interchangeably.
    <div class="box snippet code">&ltspan class="inline math"&gt<em>Put your inline math in here...</em>&lt/span&gt</div>
    <p><span class="inline math">... and it will look like this.</span></p>

    <h4>MATH FORMULA BLOCK</h4>
    <div class="box snippet code">&ltdiv class="box formula math"&gt<em>Put your math formula here...</em>&lt/div&gt</div>
    <div class="box formula math">... and it will look like this.</div>

    <h4>THEORY DEFINITION BLOCK</h4>
    <div class="box snippet code">&ltdiv class="box definition"&gt<em>Put your definition here...</em>&lt/div&gt</div>
    <div class="box definition">
      <p>... and it will look like this.</p>
    </div>

  <!--              -->
  <!-- ATTRIBUTIONS -->
  <h2 id="attribution">ATTRIBUTION</h2>
  <section class="sub-section">
    <p>Any and all resources fetched from somewhere else need to be clearly attributed, prefereably in direct proximity to the material itself. The most appropriate method is to a variant of the Harvard model. It is best to introduce the source and link it properly so that the reader understands clearly how the reference relates to the discussed material. For standard literature references, author and year as a hyperlink will do.</p>
